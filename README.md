## üóÇÔ∏è Why Comic Binder?

If you're a digital comic collector, you've probably found yourself juggling scattered `.cbz` or `.cbr` files ‚Äî separate issues, tie-ins, minis, or collected events split across folders. **Comic Binder** helps you organize your collection more like a bookshelf:

- üìö Group a miniseries into a single digital volume.
- üß© Merge event tie-ins in the proper reading order.
- üñºÔ∏è Add a proper cover image so your archive looks like a real collected edition.

**In short:** Comic Binder helps you treat your digital comics like a curated library, not a pile of files.
